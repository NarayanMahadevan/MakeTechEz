#Recursion and Function Prototypes

["Recursion"](#Recursion)   


<a name="Recursion"/>
In the previous tutorial, you learned how to repeat a computation using iteration statements. In this section, you will learn how to repeat computations using recursive function calls.   
__Recursion__ is when a function calls upon its self withen its definition. There are two parts to writing recurions, the __base case__ and the __recursive step__.   
Take for example how fast rabbits multiply with the following assumptions. 
*Female rabbits mature 1 month after birth.
*Once mature, female rabbits have one female child each month.
*At the beginning of the first month, there is one immature female rabbit.
*Rabbits live forever.
*There are always enough males to mate with the mature females.
