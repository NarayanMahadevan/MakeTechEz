Section 1:Virtual member functions
  Explains how using inheritance can be used to create an array with differnt types of classes in it
  Exaplin how virtual member functions force subclasses to have these functions
Section 2:Switch statements
  Explain the generic form of switch statments and their uses. In the program, the numbers are switched with the enumerated types
  so a generic example in the tutorial would be useful
Section 3:Enumerated Types
  Side Step:S8_Enumerated_Types
  Explain the uses of enumerated types in makeing the program more readible. THe side step explains how the values of the 
  enum variables are set. The next is always one more then the value of the previous.
