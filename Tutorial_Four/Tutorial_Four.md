[Numerical Predicates](#Predicates)


<a name="Predicates"/>
Functions that return values that are either true or flase are called predicates. C++ offers several predicates that test the relationship between numbers
| Predicate     | Purpose
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ==            | Are two numbers equal?|
| !=            | Are two numbers not equal?|
| >             | Is the first number greater than the second|
| <             | Is the first number less than the second?|
| >=            | Is the first number greater than or equal to the second|
| <=            | Is the first number less than or equal to the second|
